- Create a new git project with the cleaned up version
- Modify the Makefile to flash the board with J-Link instead of ST-Flash (so I can leave J-Link on for debugging)
- Create a modular C++ interface for GPIO toggling
  - Write the class, etc and then figure out how to compile it separately with g++ and link them together afterwards
