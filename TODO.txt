- Go through the GTest/GMock videos and get basic test running for the button task of main
- Create a few tests that test specific functionality while mocking the hardware elements
  - can't figure out how to modify the CMake file to include GMock (done)
  - watch the gmock series on youtube (channel: codesbay) for a simple setup (done)
- After testing/refactoring is done, create project for the target
  - how to structure unit testing with respect to core project directory?
- Add the tested code and supplement the HW side
- Run the code on the target and make sure it works
- Create a modular C++ interface for GPIO toggling
