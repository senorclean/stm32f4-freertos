- Improve the CMake file
  - use file and GLOB so I don't need to manually add all the files
  - consolidate the target_... stuff with the other stuff to make everything consistent
  - add an extra target for cleaning and flashing
  - figure out how to properly structure the CMake stuff in a real project so I don't need to go into build directory everytime to build project
- Create a modular C++ interface for GPIO toggling
  - Write the class, etc and then figure out how to compile it separately with g++ and link them together afterwards
